# bb2-mode
An Emacs major mode for Blitz Basic II (a basic compiler for the Amiga)

bb2 mode provides syntax highlighting for ascii Blitz Basic II source code.

My first ever Emacs Lisp code, so bear with me.

## Todo
* Add more 3rd party commands
* separate keywords and functions? (unlike bb2 editor)
* nicer/smarter indenting (current settings more or less like bb2 editor)
* capitalize/title-case keywords like the bb2 editor does
* load and save tokenized bb2 files (somehow)
* find out if we can communicate from Emacs -> WinUAE -> ARexx -> Blitz for various things
