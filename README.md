# bb2-mode
An Emacs major mode for Blitz Basic II (a basic compiler for the Amiga)

bb2 mode provides syntax highlighting for ascii Blitz Basic II source code.

My first ever Emacs Lisp code, so bear with me.

## Todo
* Add more 3rd party commands
* add AmigaDos library functions that Blitz knows about
* sort out tabs to match bb2 editor
* capitalize/title-case keywords like the bb2 editor does
* load and save tokenized bb2 files (somehow)
* find out if we can communicate from Emacs -> WinUAE -> ARexx -> Blitz for various things
